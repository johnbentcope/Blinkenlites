# Pixel Purse HUB75 panel schematics

Reverse engineered schematics for the Pixel Purse's P6F8MS-M3216C7 panel, the 2014.09.23 revision.

DNP elements are excluded for the time being.

All reference designators match the original board, other than UB3 and UB4, the constant current drivers for the lower blue channels. On the board, a mistake is that their designators are duplicates of UG3 and UG4, the lower green channel drivers.
